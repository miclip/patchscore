/**
 * §7.1/#159/#78. The exact traversal every shipped direction walks, seed by seed.
 *
 * #159's closing measurement put the search at bounded-on-arrival for 86.4% of its nodes on
 * `industrial-techno` and 86.7% on `weave`, so the bound is where the cost lives — and #78 said
 * the answer was a sharper bound rather than a bigger cap. **Both have now happened, and the
 * rule for this table changed with them.**
 *
 * The original rule was that any one-node change here is a failure, because the work being
 * guarded was meant to make the *same* bound cheaper to evaluate. That still holds for that kind
 * of work. But a change that makes the bound *tighter* is a different thing: it returns a larger
 * admissible value, prunes strictly more, and reaches an identical answer from fewer nodes. That
 * is not a regression to explain, it is the point. So there are now three reasons a row moves,
 * and they want different responses:
 *
 *  - **The library moved** — a device, a direction, a recipe. Re-record; the problem changed.
 *  - **The bound got tighter.** Re-record, but only alongside evidence that the *answer* did not
 *    move: `test/search-matching-floor.test.ts` diffs whole results against the previous floor
 *    and is the thing that makes a re-record here safe rather than convenient.
 *  - **Anything else.** A failure. A bound that returns a different value at the same node
 *    without being provably tighter is a different bound, whether it prunes more or less.
 *
 * The figures below were re-recorded when `liveFloor` gained the one-step matching repair (#78),
 * and again when the Subharmonicon landed (#135) — the first of the three reasons above, the
 * library moving. Every row rose: `industrial-techno` 8,309 → 9,507 at its peak, `weave`
 * 4,803 → 5,461, `ambient-dub` 759 → 806, and the two flat directions by one node each. That is
 * a twentieth device serving fourteen roles with nineteen recipes, which is the growth curve
 * `DEFAULT_NODE_CAP` describes rather than a bound that changed.
 *
 * The pre-repair row for `industrial-techno` peaked at 165,785 nodes on seed 9 against 8,309
 * after the repair; that number is pinned in `test/search-matching-floor.test.ts` against the
 * deliberately unrepaired floor, so the before and the after are both still measured. It moved
 * to 221,573 with the same device, which is the unrepaired floor growing exactly as this matrix
 * did and is why that file re-records alongside this one.
 *
 * **`ambient-dub` was re-recorded a second time**, at 25,798 → 759, when the repair's buckets
 * stopped being about `sustain` and became about sections: a bucket is now any set of requests
 * on one voice whose sections pairwise overlap, so the direction's one transient request in nine
 * joins the continuous ones instead of standing outside every bucket. Nothing else in the matrix
 * moved — `industrial-techno`'s two transients occupy disjoint sections and `relay`'s are all it
 * has, so neither gains a bucket — and the whole matrix's worst case falls 25,798 → 8,309. The
 * same commit's `test/search-matching-floor.test.ts` diffs whole results against the unrepaired
 * floor over 18,400 pairs, which is the evidence this re-record needs.
 *
 * `nodeCap: 20_000_000` is the cap lifted clear of the measurement. Nothing in this matrix caps
 * at `DEFAULT_NODE_CAP` today, so the figures are the same either way, and lifting it says that
 * the numbers are the search's true cost rather than something the cap shaped. A capped run
 * reports the cap and not what the walk would have been, which is the one number a degraded
 * search cannot give you.
 *
 * The whole sweep is 168 exhaustive searches. It used to take about fifteen seconds, nearly all
 * of it in `industrial-techno`; the repair took it under two.
